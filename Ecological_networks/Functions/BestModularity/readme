F_best_modularity is a function written in R code that estimates Modularity of a bipartite network using the QuaBiMo algorithm (Q) by Dormann & Strauss.

The modularity value Q is simply the likelihood value. This value may vary between runs. 
The functions run 100 times the QuaBiMo algorithm and select the best solution (i.e., maximum likelihood.
Then extract C & Z values from this solution.
