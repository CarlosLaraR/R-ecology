The main transformation function is vcf2dadi(). It requires two input files. One is the VCF file, and the other is a so-called popmap file. The popmap file is a tab-delimited two-column text file. Its first column specifies the IDs of the individuals included in the VCF file (the individuals should be arranged in the same order as in the VCF file; the IDs do not need to be the same as those in the header line of the VCF file). The second column specifies the populaton ID of each individual (coded in integers).
